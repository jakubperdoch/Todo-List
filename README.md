# React Native Expo Go: ToDo List with AsyncStorage

## Introduction

Welcome to the React Native Expo Go ToDo List application. This project serves as a simple yet effective tool for managing your daily tasks on the go. Leveraging AsyncStorage, your todo items are securely stored locally on your device, ensuring seamless access and persistence across sessions.

## Project Overview

This application harnesses the power of React Native and Expo Go, along with AsyncStorage, to provide a hassle-free ToDo List experience. Below, you'll find essential information to help you set up the development environment, understand project structure, and contribute to its enhancement.

## Recommended IDE Setup

For an optimal development experience, we recommend using Visual Studio Code (VSCode) as your primary integrated development environment (IDE). Enhance your React Native development with the following extensions:

- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [React Native Tools](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=msjsdiag.vscode-react-native)
- [Expo Tools](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=byCedric.vscode-expo)

## Customize Configuration

For detailed information on project configuration and Expo settings, refer to the [Expo Documentation](https://docs.expo.dev/).

## Project Setup

To get started with development, follow these steps:

```sh
npm install
```

### Run the Application

```sh
expo start
```

This command starts the Expo development server and provides options to run the application on various platforms like Android, iOS, or web.

### Building the Application

When you're ready to deploy your application, use the following command to build:

```sh
expo build:<platform>
```

Replace `<platform>` with the target platform (`android`, `ios`, or `web`) you intend to build for.
